requirejs-multipage-template-with-backbone-access
=================================================

A starter template for people hoping to leverage require.js / r.js across multiple pages while having access to backbone / other js libraries if they need it as well as the option to add page specific javascript functions to pages without the need for a backbone router.  This is NOT a template for a backbone driven app.
